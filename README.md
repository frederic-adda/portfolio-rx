# portfolio-rx
Mockup of a portfolio detail in MVVM / RxSwift

This is a mockup to support a presentation at Cocoheads Lyon on January 11th, 2018.
There are 2 folders: 
- "Stock detail (MVVM)"
- "Stock detail (Rx)"

Each one contains a viewModel named `StockDetailViewModel` and a viewController named `StockDetailViewController`.
As obviously the app can't compile with 2 active classes bearing the same name, check / uncheck the target for each of theses classes in their respective folders.
